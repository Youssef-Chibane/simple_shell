# SIMPLE SHELL

This is the second ALX team project where we try to recreate the Bash (Unix shell) using the knowledge we gained from the previous tasks.

## WHAT IS SHELL?

In computing, a shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

### COMMAND-LINE SHELL

A command-line interface (CLI) is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system, interactively. For example, a teletypewriter can send codes representing keystrokes to a command interpreter program running on the computer; the command interpreter parses the sequence of keystrokes and responds with an error message if it cannot recognize the sequence of characters, or it may carry out some other program action such as loading an application program, listing files, logging in a user and many others. Operating systems such as UNIX have a large variety of shell programs with different commands, syntax and capabilities, with the POSIX shell being a baseline.

## FORMATS WE HANDLED

- c: Character
- s: String of characters
- %: The % character
- d and i: Signed decimal integer
- b: The unsigned int argument is converted to binary
- u: Unsigned decimal integer
- o: Signed octal
- x: Unsigned hexadecimal integer
- X: Unsigned hexadecimal integer (capital letters)
- S: Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
- r: Prints the reversed string
- R: Prints the rot13'ed string
